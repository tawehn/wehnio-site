# Wehn.io Site

This repository contains the code for my personal site, built using [Phenomic](https://github.com/MoOx/phenomic). Note that the markdown files for the posts and other content are not included in this repository. Those files are stored separately, but loaded into the content folder on build.

The package.json folder contains all the configurations for the site, including email/linkedin links and build targets.
